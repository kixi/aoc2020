re-find
re-seq


(partition-all 2 1 xs)
instead of
(map vector xs (rest xs))

(some->)
(str/escape)
(-> ....
   (->> ...))

reduced to stop reduce - can be also used for own steps
(reduced? x) to test if a val was reduced

some returns result of predicate function (first result)

some? same as (comp not nil?)
